haxe-dice is a(nother!) die roll manager. It is primarily a personal interest project to produce something which can be used across a variety of platforms. As such, it is written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org), targeting initially javascript (either in-browser or nodejs) as an external dependency, although it should be generically compatible with any Haxe target (JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash).

Documentation is WIP, for not, API docs can be found at https://s3.lucases.co.uk/haxe-dice/docs/pages/index.html
